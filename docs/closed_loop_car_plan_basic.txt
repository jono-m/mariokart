Physics logic OUTPUT
	[9:0] map_information_x
	[8:0] map_information_y

Physics logic INPUT
	[1:0] map_info_item
	[1:0] map_info_surface



SET map_information_x and map_information_y to the pixel you are interested in examining on the map for if an item is there and what kind of surface it is (Grass etc)
[wait 1 clock cycle for BRAM read]
MAP INFORMATION available in item and surface

the game logic sendsthe xy coordinates of the car led to the physics logic
the game logic also sends the texture of the pixel at that coordinate
