DRIVER SIMULATOR
	Receive
		wire forward
		wire [1:0] speed
		wire [1:0] turn
	Output
		[x,y] position

	Keep track of
		reg [x,y] position
		reg [8:0] angle

	To update:
		signed deltaX = (forward ? 1 : -1) * speed * cos(angle)
		signed deltaY = (forward ? 1 : -1) * speed * sin(angle)
		position_x += deltaX;
		position_y += deltaY;
		case turn
			LEFT: angle += speed
			STRAIGHT: angle = angle
			RIGHT: angle -= speed
